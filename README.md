# Cipher-Project
Different Ciphers to encrypt or decrypt a message
# 🔐 Python Encryption Project

This is a simple Python project demonstrating encryption techniques:

- Caesar Cipher
- Atbash Cipher
- Rail Fence Cipher (Custom 3-Rail)

---

## 💡 How It Works

You can:
- Encrypt a message using different ciphers
- Decrypt it back to the original message
- Use brute-force Caesar decryption
- Add your own logic!

---

## 🔢 Example

Original Text: `viveknegi`  
Caesar Cipher Encrypted: `ylyhnnhjl` (Shift 3)  
Atbash Cipher: `erevpmtzr`  
Rail Fence Encrypted: `vvkeieing`  
Decrypted: `viveknegi`

## 🔐 How to Run This Encryption Project

To start the encryption tool, run:

```bash
python opening.py
